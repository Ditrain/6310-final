      <h1>Rosetta Stone:</h1>
      <h4>A technique for communicating novel information using elements of common understanding.</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
          Sometimes trying to understand new concepts or information can seem all but impossible. The learning mind
          reaches far and wide to draw from existing connections and indicators to solve the current puzzle. It can feel
          like peering through an impenetrable haze to make out some indistinct shape. However, with the right tools and
          techniques, the picture becomes clearer, and the learner can see the pattern and understand the concept. A
          design principle that reflects these tools is known as a Rosetta stone, which is a technique for communicating
          novel information using elements of common understanding. The stone that this principle is named after has
          enabled modern humans to understand ancient Egyptian writing, yet the concept is also employed in the common
          crossword puzzle and the lofty reaches of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
            title="The Pioneer Plaque">interstellar communication</a>. Designers and educators can use the
          principle across courses, systems, and demographics. Anytime new information is to be deciphered or
          understood, consider the use of keys, references, and archetypal representations to help the learner draw
          appropriate conclusions and make accurate classifications. When doing so, it is important to highlight the
          significance and use of the key itself. It must be clear what the key is and how it should be used. The
          Rosetta stone can come in many forms such as a stand-alone tool, as marginal information, or embedded within
          the content itself which the student can readily use to compare newly presented information with a known
          reference.

            title="Humand brains as a pattern seeking machine">pattern-seeking
            apparatus</a>. It is an incredibly
          efficient and usually accurate, system that saves time and mental calories. Seeing patterns and connections
          happens so often and so quickly that we rarely notice it unless an error occurs. Rosetta stones, when designed
          for and employed appropriately, allow us to employ this system while keeping learning on track. They can be
          used in-line with other universal design principles like advance organizers, archetypes, recognition over
          recall, and performance load. Recognition and performance load are especially useful here because of the
          cost-benefit, where we get the speed and accuracy of recognition while reducing extraneous information.
          Additionally, Rosetta stones can help the designer and educator meet <a href="http://udlguidelines.cast.org/"
            data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Universal Design for Learning">UDL</a> guidelines of
          Sustained Effort &
          Persistence, Language & Symbols, and Comprehension. Effective employment should increase attention, add
          novelty, and the feeling of discovery. With the possibility of finding new and different things, engagement
          should also increase. A well designed and used key reference also provides seamless and timely error
          correction and feedback. Better still, all this can be accomplished while saving time and real estate via the
          use of iconic imagery and previously learned information.

              Mathematical concepts both abstract and concrete can take time to understand and remember, both because
              of the sheer volume of symbols we are expected to learn, and because of the operations they represent.
              Implementing charts and available reference material can be useful keys to unlocking each symbol's
              potential. Here is an example chart of both common and more obscure symbols that can be easily referenced
              due to its use of chunking and color-coding.

              Trying to navigate an unfamiliar place can be especially challenging if the map you have for navigation is
              hard to understand. Most well-designed maps circumvent this through the use of easy to recognize symbols,
              keys, and marginal information. This example of the London Metro does a fantastic job of embedding its
              Rosetta stone in the lower right-hand corner, helping riders see where to go, and find their way more
              easily. This type of key concept can be imbedded in learning material to better comprehend unfamiliar
              content.

              This example of a dichotomous key has a couple of beneficial characteristics. It helps the user correctly
              identify a given tree type and to visualize where each tree stands categorically in relation to the
              others. Not all the columns keys require the use of imagery but as we can see in this example using text
              and pictures together can make it easier to traverse. This is a specific use case, but as a model the
              dichotomous key can be employed throughout education and training to better identify and understand
              concepts.

              Reference charts can be useful for even the most mundane bits of information. On the left is an example of
              a volume conversion chart that acts as a quick reference to understand standard measurement. This example
              is made more effective through the use of symmetry and simplicity, along with the corresponding text.
              On the right we have an easy to read fire extinguisher chart that helps the user match the appropriate
              fire extinguisher with the type of fire that they may be faced with. Not only to understand which fire
              extinguisher they should purchase but also to help keep the situation from going from bad to worse.
