      <h1>Performance Load:</h1>
      <h4>The greater the effort to accomplish a task, the less likely the task will be accomplished successfully.</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
          The tools and systems that surround a learner can either help or hinder learning. This truth is captured in
          the design principle of Performance load, which states that the greater the effort to accomplish a task, the
          less likely the task will be accomplished successfully. By stripping away unnecessary obstacles and
          information
          we can increase the learner’s likelihood of completing the desired learning task. Performance load can be
          broken into two categories; Cognitive, dealing with mental activity, and Kinematic, which concerns physical
          activity. For example, a learning workbook with hard to read font, poorly worded instructions, and unclear
          objectives can tax the student’s mental reserves independent of what’s being learned or tested. This type of
          cognitive load decreases the student’s likelihood of completing the workbook, hinders learning, and makes
          evaluation difficult. In the same vein, a software-based learning program whose user interface feels
          unresponsive and unwieldy while requiring multiple clicks to navigate seemingly simple tasks creates an
          unnecessary Kinematic load, which may frustrate the user, sap their attention, and ultimately decrease the
          program’s effectiveness. Designers and educators who remove distractions and barriers can reduce the
          performance load experienced by their students, thereby freeing up valuable mental and physical resources
          which can then be channeled to attention and engagement towards the desired learning outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Performance load is important to manage because humans can only truly focus their attention on one thing at a
          time, and attention is the single most valuable commodity the designer or educator can seek to capture and
          hold. It is the filter that allows for concentration and is central to <a
            href="http://parisinnovationreview.com/articles-en/did-neuroscience-find-the-secrets-of-learning"
            data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Secrets of human learning">human learning</a>. We only
          have so many
          calories to give at any point in time, and learning is best served when as many calories as possible are
          spent, or conserved, towards the desired outcome. By removing distraction, extra steps, and extraneous
          processes, we free up attention and allow the learner to focus on the information or actions that matter most.
          Doing so helps the educator to align with <a href="http://udlguidelines.cast.org/" data-toggle="tooltip"
            data-placement="top" title="Universal Design for Learning">UDL</a> principles of Recruiting Interest,
          Perception, and
          Comprehension. We see these benefits throughout the world of design in concepts like chunking, cost-benefit,
          and Pareto’s principle, where salient information and actions pay the greatest dividends. We can work to
          decrease Performance load by focusing on a few key situations: when the material is new or complex, when
          presenting or demonstrating new information, and when constructing mental schemas to help navigate future
          scenarios. See below for five examples.

              PowerPoint tends to be the consumate whipping boy for extraneous information, and for good reason. Often
              It's because there's too much text on a slide. On the left, we see a well-meaning example where the text
              is not necessarily overbearing but there's simply too much imagery going on, and it contains clipart that
              may add levity but also adds distraction. On the right, we see a simplified and cleaned up
              version that only contains the relevant information for the slide. Here we reduce performance load by
              destributing content across more slides, and reduce the volume of content on any given slide.

              When giving instructions for a new system, or complicated task, the temptation can be to cover every
              possible scenario. Small manageable steps and simplification can be the key. This example does not do
              that. It helps students understand how to conduct an analysis of variance using statistical modeling

              Sometimes a teacher or facilitator may feel like flooding the learning environment with useful tools and
              visualizations will help the student. When in fact being surrounded by so many stimuli may work against
              the student's ability to focus on a given task. Here we see an example of a comfortable classroom that
              takes a more minimalist approach thereby reducing extraneous performance load and allowing the student to
              pay attention to relevant content. Some may see it as stark, but it helps to minimize sensory overload.

              Certain new tasks can feel so overwhelming that it makes the learners head spin, and it's all they can
              do to focus on the mechanics of getting through it. This is an example of intrinsic performance load and
              learning to drive falls under this category for many. We can help reduce intrinsic performance load via
              step-by-step processes containing introductory material, discussion, simulations, and practice.

              Another type of performance load is germane cognitive load and is different from the other examples. This
              type of load is desirable because it assists the learner in developing a mental schema to understand a new
              concept and helps to offset other types of performance load. FOIL is a prime example of germane cognitive
              load by using a mnemonic device to develop a mental picture of how to deconstruct a particular problem
