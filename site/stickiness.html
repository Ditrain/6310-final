      <h1>Stickiness:</h1>
      <h4>A method for dramatically increasing the recognition, recall, and unsolicited sharing of an idea or
        expression.
        </h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
          Some lessons last a lifetime. They contain bits of information we never forget. Perhaps it was a simple phrase
          recited by a respected mentor, or an unpleasant surprise that changed your perspective, as different as these
          examples may be, unforgettable lessons all have one thing in common, they stick. As a design principle,
          stickiness is defined as a method for dramatically increasing the recognition, recall, and unsolicited sharing
          of an idea or expression. It incorporates six different factors that work to determine how memorable an item,
          concept, or data-point will be. These factors are simplicity, surprise, concreteness, credibility, emotion,
          and story. Each of the six elements of stickiness has its own lines of research, correlations, and
          consequential behaviors, but they were first published as a cohesive idea by Chip and Dan Heath in the book 
          <a href="https://heathbrothers.com/books/made-to-stick/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
            title="Made to Stick"><em>Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</em></a>. These
          concepts have been used since the dawn of
          civilization, and the impact of their reach
          <a href="https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/julyaugust/feature/lessons-demigod" data-toggle="tooltip"
            data-placement="top" title="Gilgamesh">spans time and industry</a>. As designers and
          educators, we can also
          use the principle of stickiness to create memorable products and lessons that help students learn and remain
          with them for years to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any concept worth teaching should be one worth remembering. If we are going to spend the time and resources,
          the product should be both memorable and effective. Stickiness concepts can help us do both, and they do so by
          tapping into the tendencies of the human heart and mind. Simplicity, for example, would have concepts conveyed
          succinctly and holistically likely using archetypes, iconic imagery, or mental models while reducing cognitive
          load. This gets to the heart of the matter without extra baggage, making the point easy to understand and
          ideally easier to remember. Additionally, story is another stickiness variable that can have a significant
          bang for the buck, especially when combined with emotion or surprise. Humans love stories. They are

            data-placement="top" title="Why Your Brain Loves Good Storytelling">core to
            our condition</a>. Few things help a new concept resonate with a student more than a compelling and
          relatable
          narrative. Yet it’s a concept often overlooked in some education and training settings. It requires a type of
          creative engagement by the designer or facilitator, but the results can be worth it. Of note here is to ensure
          the story is salient to the audience and the topic. We need to be able to draw direct correlations between the
          narrative and the desired learning outcome. I.e. “our hero was able to solve the problem because they followed
          the same steps we are covering today”. Finally, credibility, concreteness, and surprise are all concepts that
          can work together, or independently, to illustrate significance, hammer home a concept, or to help the student
          take notice. As an innately

            data-placement="top" title="'Hard-wired' For Hierarchy">hierarchical species</a>, we are predisposed to
          pay attention to status. As designers
          and educators, we can use this to relay the significance or applicability of a point. By using someone the
          audience views with position or standing, we can make the point either more relatable or noteworthy,
          especially if the example is from a surprising source and speaks to their concerns. Ultimately, stickiness
          increases the effectiveness of any training or education product or program while meeting

              Compelling stories stick and have the added benefit of being multi-use tools. The same story can be
              used across an array of potential topics, which helps to create connection and context. Historical stories regarding
              the Boston Tea Party for example can bring life to a history lesson, an economics class, or a social sciences topic, 
              just to name a few. It's a unique event in American History that involved a memorable act, famous figures, relatable
              emotion, and surprise behavior.

              With Occam's razor in mind, sometimes we need to relay a nuanced concept succinctly and memorably.
              Jonathan Haidt’s analogy of the elephant and the rider does just that. It simply relays the idea that our
              brain has two mental processes that may or may not work together. It's a profound concept illustrated in
              a way that both adults and children can understand.

              Surprise is a fantastic way to gain attention and make something memorable. Take for instance the somewhat
              surprising statement that many animals avoid power lines because they can see the ultraviolet flash is
              coming off of it that we cannot. This could be a useful lead into a lesson on the electromagnetic
              spectrum. Or, to bring into perspective the age of the pyramids we might reveal that some mammoths were
              still alive when they were being constructed.

              We live in a unique time when credibility exists on a distorted sliding scale. To utilize the
              credibility variable of stickiness we need to assess who the target audience deems credible on a given
              topic. For example, the image of the white male doctor has been historically effective for endorsing
              health-related ideas and products. Conversely, some behaviors or personal care type products might be more
              successfully sold by using a different interpretation of credibility or relatability, such as a celebrity
              or respected member of the audience cohort, as we see in this Goop image.
