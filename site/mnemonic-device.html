      <h1>Mnemonic Device:</h1>
      <h4>A method of reorganizing information to make the information easier to remember.</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
          Music has an almost magical ability to transport us to a different place or time. It does so by tapping into
          several different <a
            href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201312/why-do-the-songs-your-past-evoke-such-vivid-memories"
            data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Song and memory">brain networks</a> and creating
          stronger memory connections. Music is not the only medium we can
          use to tap into this potent memory phenomenon. Sounds, words, and imagery can all be used to help us remember
          specific information. As designers and educators, we can exploit this reality via the design principle of the
          mnemonic device, which is a method of reorganizing information to make the information easier to remember.
          These mnemonic device has been in use since before the time of <a
            href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261760419_A_Brief_History_of_Mnemonics" data-toggle="tooltip"
            data-placement="top" title="History of Mnemonics">Aristotle</a>. A use case we may already be
          familiar with helps children remember the visible colors of the rainbow in the form of ROY-G-BIV. In this
          example, we have a male-sounding that helps recall that the visible colors of the rainbow are: Red, Orange,
          Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Remembering the colors of the rainbow might seem like a novel use,
          however, an instructional designer, trainer, or educator might choose to utilize a Mnemonic Device for a broad
          range of scenarios where remembering specific information is important.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mnemonic Devices are effective memory tools because they capitalize on the brain's bias towards association
          and novelty. Additionally, they sync well with proven design concepts such as stickiness, chunking, and the
          von Restorff Effect. A couple of things happen in the brain when using an effective mnemonic device: 1) It
          creates an association between something we already know and something we are trying to remember. The brain is
          constantly looking for associations, usually at the subconscious level, because doing so saves mental
          calories, and helps things fit in the bigger pattern. 2) It also utilizes novelty, something the brain tends
          to pay attention to because new and different are more noticeable and memorable. Effective mnemonic devices
          also align with several <a href="http://udlguidelines.cast.org/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
            title="Universal Design for Learning">UDL</a> principles. Namely Perception, Language & Symbols,
          Comprehension, and Expression & Communication.
          Ease of memory is a straightforward reason to use a mnemonic device, and here are several established
          techniques to help us do just that.

            <p class="card-text">
              Our previous example of ROY-G-BIV is an instance of using the first letter of each word in a data set to
              create a new word sequence that is easier to remember. Also referred to as acrostics, this method is a
              great way to create novel associations that stick. Here we see two examples. PEMDAS, a commonly used
              mnemonic, which helps elementary students remember the mathematical order of operations. We also see here
              a creative
              hybrid approach that uses both 1st letter and keywords to help students remember Group 1 and group 2
              elements of the periodic table.

              Keyword mnemonic devices use familiar information, words, sounds, or imagery to create an association with
              new information. This type of mnemonic device has a great deal of utility and can be used across a broad
              range of topics and settings. Here we see an example of a keyword mnemonic devices to help create keyword
              associations between content and images. This one is meant to help students remember the cranial nerves
              and their locations.

              Rhyming Mnemonic Device, which has likely been used since the dawn of civilization to help pass oral
              tradition from one generation to the next. Here are two prime examples of using the power of rhyme to
              remember concepts that are challenging for many people.

              Feature-Name Mnemonic Devices use specific imagery to elicit a visual cue and create an association. These
              devices fill a slightly narrower, yet powerful, use case where specific features of an entity are used to
              aid recall. The Purdue Online Writing Lab logo is a good example because it ties in several visual
              associations that make it easy to remember both what it does and what it symbolizes.

              Another ancient memory technique is the Method of Loci mnemonic device, also known as the Memory Palace,
              which has helped stage performers and the like remember their lines as least as far back as <a
                href="https:/www.verywellhealth.com/will-the-method-of-loci-mnemonic-improve-your-memory-98411"
                data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="More on Method of Loci">500 B.C.</a> This
              technique uses visualization to mentally organize information by associating it with a known physical
              space. For example, modern memory athletes often use their homes as the physical space within which they
              associate a card sequence. Perhaps the Queen of Hearts is the first card in the deck and greets them at
              the front door, holding six shovels(6 of Spades). This example hosted on Prezi illustrates a way to
              make it easier to remember the president .
