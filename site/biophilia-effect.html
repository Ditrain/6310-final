        <h1>Biophilia Effect:</h1>
        <h4>Environments rich in nature views and imagery reduce stress and enhance focus and concentration.</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
            Nature can be a dangerous place, especially for humans. In the wilderness, threats are often real and
            immediate. Yet taking someone from the “safe” comforts of civilization and into the wilderness normally
            reduces their stress level. Think of your own experiences in nature. Be it walking, hiking, camping, or
            otherwise, chances are that you have experienced the stress-relieving power of natural settings. This
            influence, known as biophilia, or
            <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/biophilia" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
              title="Biophilia">love of life
            </a>, is a
            powerful mechanism that designers and educators can
            capitalize on to increase learning and overall system effectiveness. The universal design
            principle of the biophilia effect states that environments rich in nature views and imagery reduce stress
            and enhance focus and concentration. Conducting a course, or lesson, in nature can be engaging and impactful
            for both the facilitator and the student. When suitable, designers and educators should consider natural and
            nature inspired settings as advantageous to learning outcomes. However, we do not have to take the class
            into the wilderness
            to reap some of the benefits, we can bring nature to the class. This does come as a tradeoff with increased
            distraction, that must be accounted for.
            Additionally, there is a veritable mountain of research showing the positive impact natural environs have on
            the human condition, both in the realms of
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760412/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"

            and

              data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Biophilia workplace benefits">design
            </a>. Designers and educators can incorporate the effect by strategically using settings that afford
            nature views, by positioning plants within a learning space, and by using nature-oriented wall coverings
            and backdrops.

            minimizing threats and distractions. The human affection for verdant environments has evolutionary roots. It
            makes sense that our brains, and thus we, would feel more at home and at peace when our surroundings reflect
            the presence of flora and conditions that meet our most basic needs. This also aligns with the universal
            design principle of savannah preference. In such environments, we may feel free of previously perceived
            threats and therefore can open our minds to other possibilities. We are better able to attend to the present
            moment; thus, the student can actively engage with the material at hand. This is no voodoo magic, but a

                Hosting classes outdoors comes with its own unique set of challenges and opportunities. We may be able
                to reduce stress and anxiety, and bring about feelings of serenity, but without appropriate engagement
                it can be easier for the audience to become distracted. This image shows the example of a classroom that
                might be good for brief discussions and as a transition point to more hands-on or interactive content.
                Weather can be a factor as well, but the payoff is often worth it!

                Introducing nature-based wall covering to a learning space is a great way to bring an outdoor feel into a
                building or classroom. This can be especially helpful when there are no windows or the windows show only
                urban environments. Another positive component of using wallcovering is that It can be changed to
                reflect the content being covered. Here is an example that takes an otherwise sterile white space and
                brings it to life with wall covering that captures a path through the woods. The path in the picture
                seems to synergize well with this transition area.

                Windows do not have to overlook some grand natural Vista to have a positive impact on the learning
                environment. By introducing a few trees and shrubs, where available, we can immediately change the
                feeling the student gets when gazing out the window. Projects like this have a potential dual benefit as
                planting the trees and shrubs can be part of the class itself. It may not be much but imagine this view
                without the tree. Even a little nature can have and noticeable impact.

                Classes can come alive in a whole new way when we can view and interact the topic of discussion as part
                of the lesson. Here we see a real strength of learning in an outdoor environment, and that is hands-on
                engagement and interactivity. The tangible beauty of this approach is that it is not just tied to the
                natural sciences. We can discuss social and cultural impacts as well as mathematical concepts that
                surround us every day. Nature provides us a limitless laboratory of possible topics, experiments, and
                memorable experiences.

              <p class="card-text">
                One of the most empowering examples of the biophilia effect is to witness humans growing plants for the
                first time. Having a garden in the classroom gives the educator a range of possible desired outcomes.
                They can be used to facilitate biology, home economics, or agriculture science classes, but perhaps more
                importantly, by bringing plants into the classroom, it impacts both the feel of the classroom and the
                way humans behave within that space. Here we see an example of a hydroponic garden using nutrient film
                technique, but with a few packets of seeds and some soil, almost any container can become a garden .
