        <h1>Advance Organizer:</h1>
        <h4>An instructional technique that helps people understand new information in terms of what they already know.</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
          Our minds are constantly looking to make associations and connections between what lays behind us and what lays before us.
          Often an automatic process, the human brain seeks to find correlations that
          help us to filter and process an almost endless stream of sensory data. As designers and educators, we can
          double down on this system to facilitate
          learning and retention of new information by using the design principle of advance organizers. First
          championed in the early 1960s as part of Ausubelâ€™s
          Subsumption Theory, advance organizers are an instructional technique that helps people understand new
          information in terms of what they already know.
          This allows for the introduction of new material within a structured framework that prepares the learner to
          synthisize new with existing knowledge.
          From a design perspective, Advance Organizers tend to fall into one of two categories: expository and
          comparative. Expository Advance Organizers are
          useful when presenting information that is unfamiliar or novel to the group, such as when introducing the
          concept of government to a middle school social
          studies class for the first time. On the other hand, Comparative Advance Organizers are valuable when
          covering material that the audience has some level
          of previous knowledge with. For example, when moving from the concept of monarchical government to
          democratic forms of government within that same middle
          school social studies class. Four established types of Advance Organizers are Narrative, Skimming, Graphics,
          and Text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advance organizers capitalize on natural learning processes to reduce performance load and increase lesson
          effectiveness. They help retention by layering new information with old and using recall to reinforce
          and tie concepts
          together. Advance organizers are best used for linear sequential instruction, and may also act as a Rosetta stone
          of sorts by
          helping to make sense of new material.
          Advance organizers integrate with several <a href="http://udlguidelines.cast.org/" data-toggle="tooltip"
            data-placement="top" title="Universal Design for Learning">UDL</a> principles by Recruiting Interest,
          increasing Comprehension, and
          Facilitate managing information & resources. Finally, they may be paired with other design principles such
          as recognition
          over recall and framing to act as a natural bridge when transitioning to a new topic. Key to the success of
          any advance organizer is that it effectively frames new information in relation to concepts the student
          already
          understands. There is a high likelihood that you have experienced an advance organizer in previous lessons
          and
          may have used one yourself. Below are five functional examples of advance organizers.

              <h5 class="card-title">Narrative advance organizer</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                The Narrative advance organizer can be a comfortable place to start because it relies on the principle
                of storytelling to prepare the
                audience for instruction. This can be a terrific utility strategy that works across a broad range of
                settings and topics without the use of additional
                materials. For example , prior to a nature field trip the teacher might relay a cautionary tale about
                plant or mushroom toxicity so that students or aware
                when they hit the trail. That same story could be useful in a Health or Chemistry class when introducing
                plant use concepts. Key to the narrative Advance
                Organizer is ensuring that the story speaks directly to the topic and the audience, as opposed to simply
                telling a story.

                Another relatively simple advance organizer that requires little additional
                material is skimming. Skimming is a pre-reading technique that Can be used by itself or with textbook use
                strategies, such as <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/sq3r-reading-comprehension-strategy-1857535"
                  data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review">SQ3R</a> (survey,
                question, read, recite, review), and requires the student to skim
                upcoming sections of their textbooks, particularly the headings and subheading, in order to familiarize
                and orient to the information that will be introduced. These two examples also employ graphics and
                iconography to make the concept more approachable and memorable .

              <p class="card-text">
                The Text advance organizer can be particularly helpful with note-taking and written organization. A
                prime example of a text advance organizer would be a written or printed outline, which the student then
                fills in throughout the lesson. The <a href="https://knilt.arcc.albany.edu/UNIT_4-_Examples_of_Advance_Organizers"

                know concerning a given topic, and then what they Learned about the topic, once the lesson reaches its
                conclusion.

                Graphic advance organizers are a useful way to organize, visualize, and connect
                information. The concept map accomplishes this by visually illustrating how information fits and
                compares. These are especially useful for organizing and picturing how ideas connect with one another. A
                biology lesson could be one natural place to use a concept map to better understand cell components as 
                students move between sub-topics.

                Venn diagrams are another example of the graphic advance organizer which are used to illustrate
                overlapping ideas or commonalities. These diagrams are a great use case because they fit existing mental models and are easy for most people to grasp.
                Here is a sample of a Venn diagram that shows commonalities between
                plant and animal cells. Notice the added imagery helps to visualize the concepts but may be better
                served in a different layout using better symmetry and alignment.
