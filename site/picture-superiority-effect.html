      <h1>Picture Superiority Effect:</h1>
      <h4>Pictures are remembered better than words.</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
          When resources like time, attention, or space are limited, pictures are one of the most effective tools a
          designer or educator can use to help increase retention and aid recall. Perhaps you only have so much real
          estate on a page for instructions, or you only have a few seconds to tell an entire story, in either case, a
          picture will likely convey the most meaning in the constrained environment. Images carry power. We have all
          heard of the value of pictures relative to words, 1:1000. The design principle which captures this phenomenon
          is known as the picture superiority effect, which simply states that pictures are remembered better than
          words. From <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/11/2/643/1806532" data-toggle="tooltip"
            data-placement="top" title="Impact of pictures on consumer memory">Advertising</a> to <a
            href="https://www.inc.com/carmine-gallo/neuroscience-says-this-ted-talk-rule-will-help-your-presentation-stand-out.html"
            data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Research on the effects of pictures">Neuroscience</a>, the
          results are in and statistically conclusive. Pictures and images
          are easier to associate with existing knowledge and recall than words are. Think of your own experience, you
          see an image, it tells a story, and in the space of moments a memory is created, or one is recalled. The
          experience can be either positive or negative, but the effect is similar, memory creation or recall. That is
          not to say that words are not powerful, they certainly can be. Especially when combined with the power of
          pictures to create a more potent effect. However, given limited space, time, or other resources, an image will
          likely generate the greatest bang for the design buck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why do pictures have such a profound effect? The answer has to do with the way the human brain encodes, stores
          and recalls information. Put simply words must be encoded into visual, auditory, or semantic format before
          being committed to memory. When we see a word, our brains must take an additional step to process it. With
          familiar words and meanings, it happens below the conscious level, but the additional step is still required.
          Images on the other hand do not require this step, and in many cases, can be understood and remembered as
          seen. Additionally, that single image carries with it a great deal of context and information. The images are
          effectively processed in the visual cortex which is several orders of magnitude larger than other sensory
          brain areas. In short, our brains are
          <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/get-psyched/201207/learning-through-visuals"
            data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Learning through visuals">built to process
            images</a> much more efficiently than text. Utilizing the
          Picture Superiority Effect in our designs and curriculum also harmonizes with
          <a href="http://udlguidelines.cast.org/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
            title="Universal Design for Learning">UDL</a> principles of Recruiting
          Interest, Perception, Language & Symbols, and Comprehension. Additionally, this effect can harmonize well with
          other design principles, such as Iconic Representation, Storytelling, and Stickiness. By capitalizing on the
          brain’s strengths in image processing, we aid both the facilitator and the student in recalling relevant
          information. We have established the power and potential usefulness of the picture superiority effect, now let
          us look at five ways we might effectively employ it.

              The natural Sciences are filled with opportunities to use the power of pictures to help students
              understand natural processes. Here we see 2 examples that use pictures to help visualize and understand
              the Water Cycle. Notice how the cycle can be relayed through pictures alone. However, through the
              effective use of added text and arrows, we can convey a great deal of information in one easy to
              understand graphic.

              It's hard to grasp the size and complexity of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, but this picture
              attempts to do so, with some success. I like this example because of the use of two images in one to
              illustrate the mechanical achievement and engineering scale at the same time. Adding a human to the
              tunnel for additional comparison might improve it. Nevertheless, the existing concept helps the viewer
              gain more of a sense than words alone would likely have done.

              We can also use comparison pictures to illustrate the presence or absence of a thing and to increase the
              dramatic effect. Here we see a powerful example of the effects of methamphetamine use. Note the effective
              layout and use of other design principles, but it is the picture-set that tells the most compelling story.
              I think it is interesting how easily the right kind of image can generate a visceral reaction. This poster
              uses several to great effect, but the single large image really brings it home.

              The use of pictures can be invaluable when introducing new tasks or concepts involving multiple steps.
              This example of how to tie common bowline knot would be much less instructive without the use of pictures.
              I like this example in particular because of its simplicity and use of the red arrow to illustrate
              movement. The text-only serves to augment each step of the process, but the steps can be understood
              with the images alone.

              Perhaps the most powerful attribute of a picture is its ability to tell a story. Here we see an example
              that illustrates some of the best and worst of our species. Pictures like the one of Tiananmen Square can
              be used to help students understand social concepts that may be unfamiliar. The content need not be this
              heavy, but it shows how complicated scenarios might become easier to deconstruct and grasp with
              appropriate imagery. This image also illustrates the potential power of photos, as evidenced by China’s
              posture towards the events surrounding. Ironically proving the very point of the protestor.

              Vision boards are personal growth visualization tools that employ the power of pictures and imagery to
              help users see their goals and future potential. When appropriately constructed a well-designed vision
              board can provide inspiration, clarity of purpose, and motivation to help its creator move towards their
              potential. This is a good example of effectively pairing behaviors with ideas through relevant imagery and
              text, without being overwhelming to look at.
